<br>
<br>
<br>Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages.
<br>
<br>
<br>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.
<br>
<br>
<br>If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at support@gtactonlinemall.com so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.
<br>
<br>
<br>2. Communications

<br>
<br>
<br>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.
<br>
<br>
<br>We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<br>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.

<br>4. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions
<br>
<br>
<br>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.
<br>
<br>
<br>5. Subscriptions
<br>
<br>
<br>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
<br>
<br>
<br>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or GTACT Pty Ltd cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting support@gtactonlinemall.com customer support team.
<br>
<br>
<br>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide GTACT Pty Ltd with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize GTACT Pty Ltd to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

<br>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.
<br>
<br>
<br>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by GTACT Pty Ltd until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
<br>
<br>
<br>At any time and without notice, GTACT Pty Ltd reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
<br>
<br>

<br>GTACT Pty Ltd will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
<br>
<br>
<br>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

<br>
<br>
<br>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
<br>
<br>
<br>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
<br>
<br>
<br>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
<br>
<br>
<br>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;
<br>
<br>
<br>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;
<br>
<br>
<br>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
<br>
<br>
<br>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at support@gtactonlinemall.com.
<br>
<br>
<br>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:
<br>
<br>
<br>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.
<br>
<br>
<br>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
<br>
<br>
<br>12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
<br>
<br>
<br>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:
<br>
<br>
<br>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:
<br>
<br>
<br>0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
<br>
<br>
<br>0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.

<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.
<br>
<br>
<br>0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.
<br>
<br>
<br>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.
<br>
<br>
<br>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.
<br>
<br>
<br>Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
<br>
<br>
<br>To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: support@gtactonlinemall.com.
<br>
<br>
<br>Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
